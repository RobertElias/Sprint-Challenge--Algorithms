#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The run time complexity would be O(n) due to the while loop. It seems the operations would exponentialy grow with the inputs. 


b) Assessing the two loops with a nested loop this will render a time
complexity = O(n^2)


c) This would be a recursion function with a time complexity of O(n).

## Exercise II

I think I would use a lower and upper boundary. The lower would be < than floor f and the upper would be >= floor f. 
I would throw an egg from the first floor to see if it breaks moving to the second floor if it doesnt break. 
While going up the floors are eliminated as the eggs dont break between my lower and upper.
The time complexity shold render O(log n).
